ETL Project 6 - Analysis of Covid 19

OVERVIEW
Utlizing data sets provided by the New York Times and the State of Indiana and Regenstrief Institute, we anaylzed Covid-19 case morbidity rates by Indiana county since March 1, 2020. Our goal is to find cases and hospitalizations by county; then examine death rates related to these figures to understand which counties had the worst case morbidity rates related to hospitalizations and cases

FINDING DATA

We discovered the New York Times database through Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/fireballbyedimyrnmom/us-counties-covid-19-dataset). To understand the scope of the data, we loaded it to a CSV reader through Jupyter notebook. The State of Indiana/Regenstrief data was downlaoded directly from the Regenstrief Institute's Covid-19 dashboard (https://www.regenstrief.org/data-downloads/). We looked at both data sets and determined it was feasible to efficiently to conduct the analysis.
